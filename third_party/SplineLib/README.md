# SplineLib
Library for spline manipulation.

## Features
Functionalities:

  - BSplines/NURBSs of arbitrary dimensionalities;
  - knot insertion/removal and degree elevation/reduction;
  - IGES, IRIT, and XML input/output (converter) as well as VTK output (sampler).

Software Development:

  - [Spack](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) support for handling dependencies and deployment of SplineLib.
  - C++20 complying with [Google C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) (a C++17 version
    is available using `git checkout c++17`).
  - <em>CMake</em> tools tested with apple-clang, clang, and gcc compilers.
  - Extensive unit tests using GTest and GMock.

## Getting Started
SplineLib can be compiled using, e.g., *apple-clang (>= 12)*, *clang (>= 10)* or *GCC (>= 9.3)*.  Start off by cloning
the SplineLib repository and changing to SplineLib's root directory

    $ git clone https://github.com/SplineLib/SplineLib.git && cd SplineLib

SplineLib depends on *pugixml* and *GoogleTest* (if you do not disable testing).  The following deployment instructions
for SplineLib differ depending on whether you want to use 1.) <em>spack</em> or 2.) <em>CMake</em>.  Please skip the
additional instructions provided for using SplineLib on CLAIX if you use a system different from CLAIX.

<details><summary><strong>Preparations on CLAIX</strong></summary><p>
The following commands prepare your environment on CLAIX for deploying SplineLib

    $ module purge && module load DEVELOP clang/11 gcc/10 cmake
</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Building/Installing using <em>Spack</em></strong></summary><p>
<em>Spack</em> (see <a href=https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#installation><em>spack</em>'s
installation instructions</a>) is convenient to manage SplineLib's dependencies

    $ spack install --only dependencies splinelib

In addition, <em>spack</em> can also be used for SplineLib itself.  Begin by registering SplineLib's <em>spack</em>
package

    $ spack repo add Scripts/Spack/splinelib

and continue by either installing SplineLib from GitHub and making it available in your current environment

    $ spack install splinelib && spack load splinelib

or by developing your modifiable copy of the SplineLib repository (e.g., using Debug or Release configuration)

    $ spack dev-build -b install splinelib@main build_type=Configuration

At some point in time, you can remove the `-b install` option from the previous command if you want <em>spack</em> to
not stop before the install phase.  Note that `--test root` can be added after `install` in both commands above to run
the tests. 
</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Building/Installing using <em>CMake</em></strong></summary><p>
If you do not want to use <em>spack</em>, you can also take care of SplineLib's dependencies and build system on your
own.  After making sure that SplineLib's dependencies are available, you can generate (e.g., using <em>CMake</em>'s
Unix Makefiles or Xcode generators) the build system for your version of SplineLib

    $ cmake -B build -G "Generator"

before building SplineLib (e.g., using Debug or Release configuration)

    $ cmake --build build --config Configuration -j8

and subsequently running the tests

    $ ctest --build-and-test . build --build-generator "Generator" --build-noclean --test-command ctest 
      --build-config Configuration -j8

If you eventually want to install SplineLib, you can type

    $ cmake --install build --config Configuration --prefix InstallPrefix
</p></details>
