[![workflow](https://github.com/tataratat/splinepy/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tataratat/splinepy/actions)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/splinepy.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/splinepy)

splinepy is a python library for splines of arbitrary dimensions and degrees.
The library supports Bezier, Rational Bezier, BSpline and NURBS with fast and easy-to-use APIs.

## Install guide
splinepy wheels are available for python3.6+ for MacOS, Linux, and Windows:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install splinepy
```

It is also possible to install current development version using `pip`. It requires a compiler that supports C++17 or higher (C++20 for debug mode - tested with gcc-10.3 and clang-12). Here are two variants:
1) Fast build - minimal and debug mode
```bash
SPLINEPY_MINIMAL_DEBUG_BUILD=True pip install git+https://github.com/tataratat/splinepy.git@main -vvv
```

2) Same build as in PyPI - full set of splines and optimized build
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/tataratat/splinepy.git@main -vvv
```
`-vvv` is not necessary, but we suggest using it, since you can see the build progress. Full build (the second option) may take a while.

Of course, you can install directly from the source.
In addition to aforementioned compilers, this requires a cmake3.16+. If you don't have cmake, easiest way to install it would be: `pip install cmake`.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:tataratat/splinepy.git
cd splinepy
git submodule update --init --recursive
python3 setup.py install
```

## Quick start
```python
import splinepy
import numpy as np

# Initialize bspline with any array-like input
bspline = splinepy.BSpline(
    degrees=[2, 1],
    knot_vectors=[
        [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0],
        [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0],
    ],
    control_points=[
        [0.0, 0.0],  # [0, 0] (control grid index)
        [0.5, 0.0],  # [1, 0]
        [1.0, 0.0],  # [2, 0]
        [0.0, 1.0],  # [0, 1]
        [0.5, 1.0],  # [1, 1]
        [1.0, 1.0],  # [2, 1]
    ],
)

# We always store control points in 2D arrays with shape
# (total_number_of_control_points, physical_dimension).
# The indexing of the control grid is defined by iterating
# lower-indexed dimensions first. But if you prefer a
# grid-like structure, try
multi_index = bspline.multi_index
grid_cps = np.empty(bspline.control_points.shape)
grid_cps[multi_index[0, 0]] = [0.0, 0.0]
grid_cps[multi_index[1, 0]] = [0.5, 0.0]
grid_cps[multi_index[2, 0], 0] = 1.0
# which also supports ranges
grid_cps[multi_index[:, 0], 1] = 0.0
grid_cps[multi_index[:, 1], 1] = 1.0
grid_cps[multi_index[:, 1], 0] = [0.0, 0.5, 1.0]

assert np.allclose(bspline.control_points, grid_cps)

# Evaluate spline mapping.
# First, let's form parametric coordinate queries
queries = [
    [0.1, 0.2],        # first query
    [0.4, 0.5],        # second query
    [0.1156, 0.9091],  # third query
]
physical_coords = bspline.evaluate(queries)

# we can also execute this in parallel using multithread
# executions on c++ side (for heavy multi-queries scenarios)
physical_coords_parallel = bspline.evaluate(queries, nthreads=2)

# this holds
assert np.allclose(physical_coords, physical_coords_parallel)

```

## Feature Summary
For details, please take a look at the [documentation](https://tataratat.github.io/splinepy).
Most of the functions are vectorized and capable of multithread executions.

### Multipatch
Splinepy offers a common interface for multipatch geometries, i.e., geometries consisting of multiple, individual splines of arbitrary types. This concept is both used for complex geometries as for Isogeometric Analysis. Multipatch objects have the following functionalities:
 - determine patch-interfaces automatically
 - identification of boundary faces
 - boundary assignement using different techniques, relying either on the boundary position or on the continuity inbetween patches
 - Boundary extraction

### IO
